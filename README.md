# Weather-Journal App

## Overview

This project is an asynchronous web app that utilizes a Web API to dynamically update the user interface with weather information. It allows users to input their zip code and feelings, and in return, it fetches real-time weather data using a Web API. The UI is then updated dynamically to display the weather information along with the user's feelings and the current date.
